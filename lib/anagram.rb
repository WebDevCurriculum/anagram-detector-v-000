# Your code goes here!

# Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct one(s).
# Your class, Anagram should take a word on initialization
# instances should respond to a match method that takes an array of possible anagrams. It should return all matches in an array. If no matches exist, it should return an empty array.

# create Anagram class
class Anagram
# attr_accessor - not sure which one yet, but should be included in class
# initialize with word 
  
# create instance methods 
# method should receive and array of possible anagrams
# method should match anagrams with the value passed through the word argument 
# return value should be an array of all matches
# if no matches exist, return value is empty array
